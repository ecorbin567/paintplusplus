# Paint++
### Authors: Elise Corbin, Victor Jiang, Lauren Park, Josh Villas, Oscar Yasunaga

Paint++ is a modern reimagining of the classic Microsoft application Paint, in which users
can draw on a canvas, as well as import and modify images. With Paint++, users can draw their
own design using images from their computer or a blank canvas, and then save the resulting image
to their computer. We recommend Paint++ as a free, functional, and useful tool for artists, 
professionals or students looking to brainstorm ideas, Photoshop users, or regular people with 
creative hobbies.

## Software Features
Paint++ has a signup and login system supported by Supabase API; see [Running Paint++](#running-paint++)
for more details. When you open the application, you will see a signup screen, where you
can create an account if you don't have one. If you already have an account, click the "Go To
Login" button.

Once you are logged in, you will be able to view and edit any past canvases you have worked
on, as well as create a new blank canvas. Within each canvas, you can draw a brushstroke of any
size and colour, erase with any size, box select, and import, resize, crop, and rotate .png images
from your computer. The menu at the top of each canvas allows you to resize the entire canvas, zoom in and out,
undo and redo actions, save the canvas to your computer, return back to the My Canvases page,
and log out. All top menu actions correspond to keyboard shortcuts as well for additional flexibility.
