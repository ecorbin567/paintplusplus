**For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which**
**features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:**

**(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or**

**(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.**


**Principle 1: Equitable Use**

No advanced knowledge is required to access core features like drawing or importing images.

**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**

Undo/redo functionality allows users to experiment without fear of permanent mistakes.

**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**

The UI closely resembles the classic MS Paint interface, leveraging familiarity and reducing the learning curve.

Icons for tools (brush, eraser, fill, etc.) are visually intuitive and labeled where necessary.

Common actions like "Save" or "Open Image" are accessible via clearly marked buttons or menus.

**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**

Buttons and tools are represented with distinct visual icons and color-coded feedback.

**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**

Users can undo and redo actions freely, encouraging experimentation and minimizing the impact of mistakes.

Files are saved remotely, reducing risk of data loss due to connectivity or server issues.

**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**

It’s simple to draw

Keyboard shortcuts are available for common tasks (e.g., Ctrl+Z for undo), reducing repetitive motion.

Interface layout minimizes excessive scrolling or reaching across the screen.

**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**

Large clickable buttons and spacing between tools prevent accidental clicks.

**Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license 
your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as 
"people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

We recommend Paint++ for casual users who are looking for quick and simple Paint functionality, 
don’t require the bells and whistles of Photoshop, and do want access to the easy
Google Drive-esque canvas saving functionality integrated into the app. 
Users will be impressed by the simplicity of the app; it takes milliseconds to load, 
unlike Adobe Photoshop or its alternatives. Our target market is 
the average computer user looking for a tool to sketch and save their ideas and 
brainstorm sessions.


**Write a paragraph about whether your program is less likely to be used by certain 
demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded 
ethics modules this term.**

We do not think that our program is less or more likely to be used by a certain 
demographic. Paint++ is made to be fast and easy to use for anyone with internet
access and a compatible operating system.
Regarding ethics and user diversity, our app 
runs on personal computer operating systems, and is not made for mobile use. 
Elderly users, as well as users with visual and motor impairments, might expect 
some difficulties using the app for the first time due to the
small text in the menus and the requirement to click
and drag on the screen. Since the main functionalities of Paint++ rely on the ability
to dexterously navigate a trackpad or mouse, users who cannot do this would be unlikely
to use our app.
